# Critical Findings: Fast2D Native Limitations

## Issue Discovered
During implementation, I discovered that **Fast2D does not currently support native desktop applications**. All Fast2D backends (webgl, webgpu, canvas) are designed exclusively for web environments and depend on `web-sys` APIs.

### Evidence
1. **WGPU Backend**: Uses `HtmlCanvasElement` from web-sys
2. **Canvas Backend**: Uses `CanvasRenderingContext2d` from web-sys  
3. **All Features**: Require web-sys and browser APIs
4. **No Native Feature**: No feature flag for native WGPU surfaces

### Specific Issues Found
```rust
// From Fast2D's CanvasWrapper
use web_sys::HtmlCanvasElement;

pub async fn new_with_canvas(canvas: HtmlCanvasElement) -> Self {
    // This requires a browser HtmlCanvasElement, not a native window
}
```

```rust
// From Fast2D's graphics.rs
.create_surface(SurfaceTarget::Canvas(canvas))
//               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// SurfaceTarget::Canvas doesn't exist in native WGPU
```

## Impact on Implementation

Our original plan assumed Fast2D could work natively, but this is not currently possible. The tauri_example works because Tauri provides a web environment (webview) where Fast2D can access browser APIs.

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Extend Fast2D with Native Backend ⭐ **(Recommended)**
- Add a new feature `native` to Fast2D
- Implement native WGPU backend that works with raw surfaces
- Modify CanvasWrapper to accept native windows/surfaces
- Preserve existing API compatibility

### Option 2: Fork Fast2D for Native Support
- Create a native-only fork of Fast2D
- Remove web dependencies
- Focus purely on native WGPU rendering
- Higher maintenance burden

### Option 3: Use Different Graphics Library
- **wgpu directly**: Write raw WGPU rendering code
- **egui**: Use egui's 2D graphics capabilities
- **iced**: Use iced's Canvas widget for 2D graphics
- **raqote**: Pure Rust 2D graphics library

### Option 4: Native WebView Approach
- Use a lightweight webview (like tauri without the full framework)
- Embed the Fast2D web version in native webview
- Less efficient but reuses existing code

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate: Extend Fast2D (Option 1)
1. **Add Native Feature** to Fast2D Cargo.toml:
   ```toml
   native = [
       "dep:wgpu",
       "wgpu/vulkan",
       "wgpu/dx12", 
       "wgpu/metal",
       "dep:glyphon",
       "dep:lyon",
       "dep:bytemuck",
       "dep:euclid",
   ]
   ```

2. **Create Native Backend**:
   ```
   src/backend/backend_wgpu_native/
   ├── canvas_wrapper.rs    # Native window version
   ├── graphics.rs          # Native surface creation
   └── mod.rs
   ```

3. **Modify CanvasWrapper**:
   ```rust
   #[cfg(feature = "native")]
   pub async fn new_with_surface(
       surface: wgpu::Surface,
       device: &wgpu::Device,
       queue: &wgpu::Queue,
   ) -> Self

   #[cfg(any(feature = "webgl", feature = "webgpu"))]
   pub async fn new_with_canvas(canvas: HtmlCanvasElement) -> Self
   ```

### Implementation Plan Update

Given this discovery, our native example should:

1. **Phase 1**: Extend Fast2D with native support
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the native Tao example using the new backend
3. **Phase 3**: Ensure feature parity with web version

This approach:
- ✅ Preserves all existing Fast2D functionality
- ✅ Maintains API compatibility for web users
- ✅ Enables true native performance
- ✅ Allows code reuse between web and native examples

## Modified Architecture

```
Native Fast2D Backend
├── Raw WGPU Surface (not HtmlCanvas)
├── Native Font Loading (not web fetch)
├── Native Input Handling (not DOM events)
└── Same Fast2D Object API (Rectangle, Circle, etc.)
```

This discovery actually makes the project more valuable - extending Fast2D to support native applications would benefit the entire Fast2D ecosystem!
