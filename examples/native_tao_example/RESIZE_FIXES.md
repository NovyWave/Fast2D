# 🔧 Window Resize Fixes for Fast2D Native

## 🎯 Problem: White Screen During Resize

The application was showing a white screen during window resize operations due to surface invalidation and improper error handling.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Improved Surface Error Handling in draw.rs**
- **Issue**: When surface errors (Lost/Outdated) occurred, we reconfigured and returned early without drawing
- **Fix**: After reconfiguring surface, retry `get_current_texture()` once more before giving up
- **Result**: Surface errors no longer cause permanent white screens

### 2. **Enhanced Resize Debouncing**
- **Threshold**: Increased from 5px to 15px to reduce excessive resize events
- **Minimum Size**: Increased from 10x10 to 50x50 pixels for stability
- **Result**: Fewer resize operations, more stable during window dragging

### 3. **Separated Resize and Draw Operations**
- **Issue**: `resized()` method was calling `draw()` internally, causing timing conflicts
- **Fix**: Use `resize_only()` method, then explicitly call `update_column_layout()` 
- **Result**: Clean separation of resize logic from drawing logic

### 4. **Added Scale Factor Change Handling**
- **Added**: `WindowEvent::ScaleFactorChanged` handler for multi-monitor setups
- **Result**: Proper resize handling when moving between different DPI displays

### 5. **Enhanced Logging and Validation**
- **Added**: Detailed logging in `resize_graphics()` function
- **Added**: Zero-dimension validation before surface configuration
- **Added**: MSAA texture creation logging
- **Result**: Better debugging and error prevention

### 6. **Simplified Event Loop**
- **Removed**: Complex async handling in resize events
- **Removed**: Unnecessary `request_redraw()` calls after resize
- **Result**: Cleaner, more predictable resize behavior

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Surface Error Recovery
```rust
// Before: Return early on surface error
Err(SurfaceError::Lost) => {
    surface.configure(&device, &surface_config);
    return; // White screen!
}

// After: Retry after reconfiguration
Err(SurfaceError::Lost) => {
    surface.configure(&device, &surface_config);
    match surface.get_current_texture() {
        Ok(texture) => texture,
        Err(_) => return, // Only return if retry fails
    }
}
```

### Resize Flow
```rust
// Before: Double drawing
canvas_wrapper.resized(width, height); // Calls draw() internally
update_column_layout(); // Calls draw() again

// After: Single drawing
canvas_wrapper.resize_only(width, height); // No drawing
update_column_layout(); // Single draw with correct layout
```

## 🚀 Expected Results

- **Stable Resizing**: No more white screens during window resize
- **Smooth Performance**: Reduced surface reconfigurations
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Proper handling of DPI changes
- **Better Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of GPU surface errors
- **Cleaner Logging**: More informative debug output

## 🧪 Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Resize window by dragging borders - should remain stable
2. Move window between monitors with different DPI - should handle scale changes
3. Rapidly resize window - should not show white content
4. Check console logs for meaningful resize information

The application should now provide a much more stable resize experience!
