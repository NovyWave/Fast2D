# Fast2D Blade Graphics Experiment

**Goal**: Test Blade Graphics as WGPU alternative for Fast2D native rendering with focus on solving window resize issues.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Validate Blade + Tao** combination for stable window operations
2. **Compare resize stability** vs WGPU implementation  
3. **Evaluate performance** - target Zed-like smoothness
4. **Test API simplicity** - Blade's "thin abstraction" benefits
5. **Proof of concept** for Fast2D Blade backend

## 🔬 Experiment Design

### **Graphics Stack**
```
Fast2D Objects → Blade Graphics → Vulkan/Metal → Native Window
                      ↑
                (instead of WGPU)
```

### **Same Requirements as native_tao_example**
- ✅ Column layout with 3 examples (Rectangle, Face, Sine Wave)
- ✅ Mouse wheel scrolling
- ✅ Embedded fonts (Inter, FiraCode)
- ✅ Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 🎯 **FOCUS**: Stable window resize without white flashing

## 🔧 Key Technical Differences

| Aspect | WGPU (current) | Blade (experiment) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Abstraction** | High-level | "Extremely thin" |
| **Surface Config** | Complex | Simplified |
| **Shaders** | WGSL + bindings | WGSL (no decorations) |
| **Error Handling** | Many layers | Direct GPU control |
| **Resize Pattern** | Standard patterns | Zed-proven approach |

## 💡 Key Insights to Validate

1. **Simpler Surface Management**: Does Blade eliminate resize complexity?
2. **Performance Benefits**: Can we achieve 120 FPS like Zed?
3. **API Ergonomics**: Is development faster with thinner abstraction?
4. **Stability**: Are there fewer edge cases than WGPU?
5. **Maintenance**: Is the codebase easier to debug?

## 🎛️ Controls (When Complete)
- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll through examples
- **Window Resize**: Test stability (main focus)
- **Close Window**: Exit application

## 📊 Success Metrics

### **Primary Goal**: Resize Stability  
- 🎯 No white flashing during window resize
- 🎯 Smooth visual updates during drag operations
- 🎯 No surface error loops

### **Secondary Goals**: Performance
- 🎯 60+ FPS sustained rendering
- 🎯 Low CPU usage during idle
- 🎯 Fast startup time

### **Tertiary Goals**: Developer Experience
- 🎯 Simpler error debugging
- 🎯 Less boilerplate code
- 🎯 Clear performance bottlenecks

## 🔍 Expected Learnings

1. **Blade vs WGPU trade-offs** for 2D graphics
2. **Optimal windowing + graphics combinations** for Rust
3. **Surface management best practices** with minimal abstraction
4. **Fast2D architecture improvements** for better native support
