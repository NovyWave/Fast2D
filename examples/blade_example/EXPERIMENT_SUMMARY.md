# 🔪 Blade Graphics Experiment - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Core Hypothesis

**Problem**: Fast2D + WGPU has white screen flashing during window resize  
**Solution**: Replace WGPU with Blade Graphics for simpler, more stable rendering  
**Evidence**: Zed editor achieves 120 FPS with stable resize using Blade

## 📋 What This Experiment Tests

### **Primary Goal**: Resize Stability
- ❌ Current: White flashing during window drag with WGPU
- 🎯 Target: Smooth resize without visual artifacts using Blade

### **Secondary Goals**: Performance & Simplicity  
- 🎯 Match or exceed current WGPU performance
- 🎯 Simpler error handling than WGPU's complex surface management
- 🎯 Proof of concept for Fast2D Blade backend

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### **Graphics Stack Change**
```
BEFORE: Fast2D → WGPU → Vulkan/Metal/DX12 → Window
AFTER:  Fast2D → Blade → Vulkan/Metal/GLES → Window
```

### **Windowing Unchanged**
- Keep Tao (proven to work)
- Same event loop patterns
- Focus purely on graphics backend differences

### **API Compatibility**
- Same 3 examples (Rectangle, Face, Sine Wave)
- Same column layout and scrolling
- Same embedded fonts approach

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ **Complete** (Project Setup)
- Project structure created
- Dependencies configured  
- Documentation planned
- Font assets copied

### 📋 **Next Steps** (Critical Path)
1. **Basic Blade Setup**: Initialize GPU context, create surface
2. **Triangle Test**: Validate Blade rendering works
3. **Resize Implementation**: Main experiment - test stability
4. **Primitive Rendering**: Rectangle, circle, line primitives  
5. **Integration**: Column layout and scrolling

## 🔍 Key Research Questions

### **1. Surface Management**
- **Question**: Is Blade surface resize simpler than WGPU?
- **Hypothesis**: Fewer abstraction layers = fewer failure points
- **Test**: Count lines of resize handling code

### **2. Error Handling**
- **Question**: Does Blade have fewer error cases?
- **Hypothesis**: Direct GPU control = simpler error recovery  
- **Test**: Compare error types and handling complexity

### **3. Performance**
- **Question**: Can Blade match WGPU performance for 2D?
- **Hypothesis**: Thinner abstraction = better performance
- **Test**: FPS comparison and frame time analysis

### **4. Integration Effort**
- **Question**: How hard is it to create Fast2D Blade backend?
- **Hypothesis**: Similar effort to WGPU but with better stability
- **Test**: Implementation complexity and API compatibility

## 🎊 Success Scenarios

### **🥇 Outstanding Success**
- Zero white flashing during resize
- 120 FPS performance like Zed
- Significantly simpler codebase
- Clear win over WGPU approach

### **🥈 Good Success**  
- Improved resize stability
- Performance equal to WGPU
- Reasonable implementation complexity
- Viable Fast2D backend option

### **🥉 Minimal Success**

## 🚨 Failure Scenarios

### **💥 Complete Failure**
- Can't get basic rendering working
- Worse performance than WGPU
- More complex than WGPU implementation
- Clear evidence to stick with WGPU

### **😐 Partial Failure**
- Works but no resize improvement
- Similar complexity to WGPU
- Platform compatibility issues
- Not worth the migration effort

## 📊 Decision Framework

### **Adopt Blade If**:
- ✅ Resize stability significantly improved
- ✅ Performance equal or better than WGPU
- ✅ Implementation complexity reasonable
- ✅ Clear path to Fast2D integration

### **Stick with WGPU If**:
- ❌ No meaningful resize improvement
- ❌ Performance worse than WGPU  
- ❌ Much more complex implementation
- ❌ Platform compatibility problems

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

### **Week 1**: Basic Setup
- Blade context initialization
- Triangle rendering test
- Surface resize implementation

### **Week 2**: Feature Implementation  
- Primitive rendering (rect, circle, line)
- Text rendering research and implementation
- Column layout and scrolling

### **Week 3**: Testing & Validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Stability testing
- Cross-platform verification
- Documentation of findings

## 💡 Key Insights Expected

1. **Abstraction Trade-offs**: WGPU vs Blade complexity comparison
2. **Resize Patterns**: What makes some approaches more stable
3. **Performance Characteristics**: 2D rendering with different backends
4. **Fast2D Architecture**: How to best support multiple native backends
